# Decks

This is a repo of various decks that I play / play against (mostly modern) via Forge Desktop.  In addition to that, I've authored a script that lets me clone this repo onto a system and then run a script (`hookup.sh`) that will make itself the decks directory (via a symlink) and allow me to source control all of my decks.  Now I can ensure I keep all of my decks in one place and I can load them onto every machine very easily.
